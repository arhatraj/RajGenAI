      "Introduction to Snowflake:\n",
      "Snowflake is a cloud data warehouse that can store and analyze all your data records in one place.\n",
      "It runs completely on cloud infrastructure, being truly SaaS.\n",
      "Snowflake handles all aspects, ongoing maintenance, management, upgrades, and tuning.\n",
      "Snowflake supports both ETL and ELT and works with a wide range of data integration tools,\n",
      "including Informatica, Talend, Tableau, Matillion etc.\n",
      "A Snowflake account can be hosted on any of the cloud platforms which are AWS, GCP, Azure.\n",
      "Snowflake delivers a platform that is fast, flexible, and user-friendly.\n",
      "Snowflake vs Traditional Warehouse:\n",
      "Snowflake Warehouse\n",
      "• PROS:\n",
      "1) Scalability-\n",
      "Snowflake enables easy scaling of computing and storage resources, allowing\n",
      "organizations to adjust their capacity based on demand.\n",
      "2) Flexibility-\n",
      "Snowflake’s architecture separates storage from computing, meaning users can optimize\n",
      "and manage each independently. This allows for more efficient resource allocation and\n",
      "cost management.\n",
      "3) Ease to use-\n",
      "As a fully managed service, Snowflake eliminates the need for manual tasks such as\n",
      "hardware provisioning, software configuration, and maintenance.\n",
      "4) Security-\n",
      "Snowflake provides robust security features, including data encryption, key management,\n",
      "and network isolation.\n",
      "5) Compatibility-\n",
      "Snowflake supports various data formats and integrates seamlessly with popular data\n",
      "processing and visualization tools.\n",
      "Page Number:  4\n",
      "• CONS:\n",
      "1) Cost-\n",
      "Snowflake’s pay-as-you-go pricing model can become expensive for\n",
      "organizations with consistently high data processing demands.\n",
      "2) Limited Control-\n",
      "As a managed service, Snowflake users have less control over the underlying\n",
      "infrastructure and configuration than traditional data warehousing.\n",
      "Traditional Warehouses\n",
      "• PROS:\n",
      "1) Control-\n",
      "When using a traditional data warehouse, organizations have more control over\n",
      "the infrastructure, configuration, and security. It is crucial to have trained people\n",
      "to maintain the implementation correctly.\n",
      "2) Customization-\n",
      "Traditional data warehousing allows for greater customization to meet specific\n",
      "business requirements and performance needs.\n",
      "3) Predictable cost-\n",
      "With traditional data warehousing, organizations typically pay for hardware and\n",
      "software upfront, resulting in more predictable long-term costs.\n",
      "• CONS:\n",
      "1) High upfront investment-\n",
      "Traditional data warehousing requires significant upfront investment in hardware,\n",
      "software, and personnel.\n",
      "Page Number:  5\n",
      "2) Scalability limitations-\n",
      "Scaling traditional data warehouses often involves costly hardware upgrades and\n",

      "Organizations must devote resources to maintaining and updating their data\n",

      "4) Flexibility:\n",
      "Traditional data warehouses are less flexible than cloud data warehouse,\n",
      "hence adapting to changing business needs is more challenging.\n",
      "Point to be Considered:\n",
      "Choosing between Snowflake and traditional data warehousing depends on the\n",
      "organization’s needs and resources. Snowflake offers scalability, flexibility, and ease of use,\n",
      "making it a popular choice for organizations that want to focus on data analysis rather than\n",

      "Redshift, BigQuery and Snowflake are similar in that they provide the scale and cost savings of a\n",
      "cloud solution. The main difference to consider is the way that the services are billed.\n",
      "If you have very large data, but a spiky workload (i.e., you’re running lots of queries occasionally,\n",
      "with high idle time), BigQuery will probably be cheaper and easier for you.\n",
      "If you have a steadier, more continuous usage pattern when it comes to queries and the data\n",

      "Snowflake Core Architecture:\n",
      "The Snowflake data platform is not built on any existing database technology or software\n",
      "platforms such as Hadoop. Instead, Snowflake combines a completely new SQL query engine with\n",
      "an innovative architecture designed for the cloud. To the user, Snowflake provides all the\n",
      "functionality of the database, along with special features.\n",
      "Snowflake’s architecture is a hybrid of traditional shared-disk and shared-nothing\n",
      "database architectures. Similar to shared-disk architectures, Snowflake uses a central data\n",
      "repository for persisted data that is accessible from all compute nodes in the platform. But like\n",
      "shared-nothing architectures, Snowflake processes queries using MPP (massively parallel\n",
      "processing) compute clusters where each node in the cluster stores a portion of the entire data\n",
      "set locally. This approach offers the data management simplicity of a shared-disk architecture,\n",
      "but with the performance and scale-out benefits of a shared-nothing architecture.\n",
      "Snowflake’s unique architecture consists of three key layers:\n",
      "1. Database Storage Layer\n",
      "2. Query Processing / Compute Layer\n",

      "The cloud services layer is a collection of services that coordinate activities across Snowflake.\n",
      "These services tie together all of the different components of Snowflake in order to process user\n",
      "requests, from login to query dispatch. The cloud services layer also runs on compute instances\n",
      "provisioned by Snowflake from the cloud provider.\n",
      "Services managed in this layer include:\n",

      "Snowflake manages all aspects of how this data is stored- the organization, file size, structure,\n",
      "compression, metadata, statistics, and other aspects of data storage are handled by Snowflake.\n",
      "The data objects stored by Snowflake are not directly visible nor accessible by customers; they\n",

      "independently for high performance. This flexible architecture ensures you don’t\n",
      "accidentally over-provision unneeded resources while also helping you optimize costs.\n",
      "• Compute Costs-\n",
      "Compute costs are billed in the form of credits that can be purchased upfront or billed\n",
      "monthly. Consumption is based on the number of virtual warehouses you use, their size,\n",
      "and how long you run them.\n",
      "• Storage Costs-\n",
      "Snowflake bills for actual storage use. This is based on the daily average number of\n",
      "monthly terabytes (TB) used. Ten TB of data becomes around one or two TB of data in\n",
      "Snowflake.\n",
      "As with compute costs, Snowflake also offers On Demand pricing and capacity pricing for\n",
      "storage. With On Demand pricing, billing is based on arrears of storage. The actual cost\n",
      "TB depends on your cloud provider and region. Snowflake then looks at the average TB\n",
      "per month and applies a minimum monthly charge of $25.\n",
      "• Snowflake Credits-\n",
      "All billing in Snowflake is based around Snowflake credits. The specific price per credit is\n",
      "based on several factors, including:\n",
      "o The Region of your Snowflake deployment\n",
      "o The Snowflake Edition\n",
      "Page Number:  13\n",
      "o The pricing agreement: On Demand or Pre-purchase\n",
      "Because several factors can influence the price of Snowflake, choosing an On Demand,\n",
      "Standard deployment of Snowflake, user can expect a minimum of $2 per credit.\n",
      "• How is Credit Usage Calculated?\n",
      "Whenever we are leveraging Snowflake computing, we will be charged credits. Credit\n",
      "consumption is calculated by taking the number of seconds your virtual warehouse is\n",
      "running and multiplying that number by the number of virtual servers in the cluster.\n",
